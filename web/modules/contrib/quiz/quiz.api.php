 * These entity types provided by Quiz also have entity API hooks.
 *
 * There are a few additional Quiz specific hooks defined in this file.
 *
 * quiz (settings for quiz nodes)
 * quiz_result (quiz attempt/result)
 * quiz_result_answer (answer to a specific question in a quiz result)
 * quiz_question
 * quiz_question_relationship (relationship from quiz to question)
 *
 * So for example
 *
 * hook_quiz_result_presave(QuizResult $quiz_result)
 *   - Runs before a result is saved to the DB.
 * hook_quiz_question_relationship_insert(
 * QuizQuestionRelationship $quiz_question_relationship)
 *   - Runs when a new question is added to a quiz.
 *
 * You can also use Rules to build conditional actions based off of these
 * events.
 *
 * Enjoy :)
